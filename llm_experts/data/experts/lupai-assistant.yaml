    And the following query:

    Provide a response in {output_language} that is clear, concise, and directly addresses the query using the provided relevant text chunks.

    - "used_chunk_ids" (list of integers): A list of `used_chunk_ids` used to generate the response.

    Do not include any additional explanation or text outside of the JSON dictionary.
