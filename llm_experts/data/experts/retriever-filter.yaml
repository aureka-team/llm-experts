    based on the most relevant provided text chunks and explain which chunks would be used.

human-prompt-template: |
    Given the following text chunks:

    {text_chunks}

    And the following query:

    {query_text}

    Identify if it is possible to answer the query based on the most relevant provided text chunks.
    Also provide a list of `used_chunk_ids` that would be used to generate the response.

    If an answer cannot be extracted from the given text chunks, the `used_chunk_ids` should be an empty list.

    The output must be a JSON formatted dictionary with the key:
    - "used_chunk_ids" (list of integers): a list of `used_chunk_ids` that would be used to generate the response

    Do not include any additional explanation or text outside of the JSON dictionary.
