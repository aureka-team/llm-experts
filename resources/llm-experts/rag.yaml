    Given the following text chunks:

    {text_chunks}

    And the following query:

    {query_text}

    Generate a concise response in {output_language} to the query based on the most relevant provided text chunks.
    Also provide a list of `used_chunk_ids` used to generate the response.
    The response should not include any direct references to the given texts, authors, or any phrases indicating the source of the information.

    If a response cannot be extracted from the given text chunks, the `used_chunk_ids` should be an empty list and the `response` should be null.

    The output must be a JSON formatted dictionary with the keys:
    - "used_chunk_ids" (list of integers): a list of `used_chunk_ids` used to generate the response
    - "response" (string): the response to the query

    Do not include any additional explanation or text outside of the JSON dictionary.
